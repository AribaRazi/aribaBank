Welcome to **aribaBank**, a beginner-friendly **Solidity smart contract** project that demonstrates how a **decentralized on-chain banking system** can work transparently and securely on the blockchain.

---

## 🏦 Project Description

**aribaBank** is a simple yet powerful example of a **transparent, decentralized banking system** built entirely on the blockchain.  
It allows users to **deposit, withdraw, and transfer ETH** securely — all actions are recorded **on-chain** for full transparency.

This project aims to **teach Solidity beginners** how to handle Ether transactions, mappings, modifiers, events, and security mechanisms such as **reentrancy protection**.

---

## ⚙️ What It Does

- 💸 **Deposits** — Users can deposit ETH directly into the contract.  
- 💰 **Withdrawals** — Withdraw your balance anytime securely.  
- 🔁 **Transfers** — Instantly send ETH (within the system) to other users.  
- 🧾 **Track Balances** — Check your balance and view others’ balances transparently.  
- 🧑‍💼 **Owner Controls** — The contract owner can perform emergency withdrawals.  
- 🔒 **Security Features** — Built-in protection against reentrancy attacks.

All transactions are **stored on the blockchain**, ensuring transparency and immutability.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🧰 Prerequisites

* [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) (no setup needed!)
* Or local setup with:

  * Node.js & npm
  * Hardhat or Foundry
  * MetaMask (for deployment/testing)

### 🪜 Steps to Run

1. Open Remix and paste the contract code into a new file named `aribaBank.sol`.
2. Compile the contract with Solidity version **^0.8.19**.
3. Deploy on any testnet (like **Celo Sepolia**, Goerli, or Sepolia).
4. Interact using the **Remix interface**:

   * Call `deposit()` and send ETH.
   * View your balance with `myBalance()`.
   * Withdraw using `withdraw(amount)`.
   * Transfer to other users via `transferTo(address, amount)`.

## 💡 Example Usage

| Action          | Description                        | Function                                 |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Deposit ETH     | Add funds to your on-chain account | `deposit()`                              |
| Withdraw ETH    | Retrieve your funds                | `withdraw(uint256 amount)`               |
| Transfer ETH    | Send ETH to another user           | `transferTo(address to, uint256 amount)` |
| View My Balance | Check your own balance             | `myBalance()`                            |
| Check Any User  | View others’ balances              | `balanceOf(address)`                     |
